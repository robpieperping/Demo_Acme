# Ping Identity DevOps
The goal of Ping Identity DevOps is to enable DevOps, administrators and 
developers with tools, frameworks, blueprints and reference architectues 
to deploy Ping Identity software in the cloud.

## Why Containerization?
**Deployments with Confidence** - Maintain all configurations and depenencies 
ensuring consitent environments.  Eliminate the "it works on my machine" 
problem.

**Cloud Flexibility** - Containers are portable.  All major cloud providers
have embraced containers and have added support.

**Right-Size** - Orchestration alows businesses to increase fault 
tolerance, availability and cost management by auto scaling to
application demand.
